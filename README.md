# SVM_digitRecognizer
Handwritten Digits recognized by trained machine using SVM (support vector Machine)

The goal is to develop a model that can correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image.
To develop a model using Support Vector Machine which should correctly classify the handwritten digits from 0-9 based on the pixel values given as features. Thus, this is a 10-class classification problem.
Samples provided from MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) data-set includes handwritten digits total of 70,000 images consisting of 60,000 examples in training set and 10,000 examples in testing set, both with labeled images from 06 digits (0 to 5).

Python for scripting
Support Vector Machine for implementing Machine Learning
OpenCV for live prediction
